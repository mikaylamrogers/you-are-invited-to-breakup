# You Are Invited to Breakup
NYU IDM Senior Thesis Project 2023 by Mikayla Mayumi Rogers

My project touches on my personal experience living between analog and digital technologies, growing up in the early 2000s.

To make my experience interactive and to present an open invitation for others to comment, relate, and react, I am referring to Smart Designâ€™s design research tool, The Breakup Letter. They created this tool to understand the emotional connection between people and their products, services, and experiences.

Today, we live in a booming digital age where the replacement cycle length of consumer smartphones is falling to 2 years. By 2030, the number of smart devices collecting, analyzing, and sharing data should hit 50 billion.

In other words, we live in a constant breakup and makeup world. In my project, I warmly invite users to write a breakup letter to a correspondent of their choice.
